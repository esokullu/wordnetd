## wordnetd

Wordnetd is an ultra-fast in-memory Wordnet daemon/server. It may be used in situations where you need to access Wordnet fast by avoiding to touch the hard drive as much as you can. With wordnetd, the data is aggressively cached in memory.

### Usage

Using wordnetd is simple. Just ```telnet localhost 4444``` (the default port in use) and then the protocol is as follows:

| Command  | Param (optional) | Description |
